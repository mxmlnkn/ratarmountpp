This repository provides a prototype of ratarmount implemented with C++ to improve performance over the Python version, which has its limits in the Python layer itself and Python's global interpreter lock.
For now, this module is a proof of concept and will only work with uncompressed and bzip2 compressed TAR files, which do have preexisting `<file name>.sqlite.index` files created by the original ratarmount.


# Installation

```
sudo apt install g++ cmake
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmountpp.git
cd ratarmountpp; mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make -j $( nproc )
sudo make install
```

# Usage

Ratarmount++ requires a preexisting index file, therefore the workflow is like follows:

```bash
ratarmount mylargetar.tar mountpoint  # creates index
fusermount -u mountpoint
ratarmount++ mylargetar.tar mountpoint
src/tools/benchmark-reading mountpoint
```
